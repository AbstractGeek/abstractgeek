## Hi, I'm Dinesh (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for visiting my github page. You can find more about me [here](https://dineshnatesan.com/).  

Here are some things I am currently doing:
- ðŸ”­ Building color VR and two-photon microscopes for insects.
- ðŸŒ± Learning to write more regularly in my [digital garden](https://umwelt.dineshnatesan.com/).
- ðŸ’¡ Thinking about how to increase my positive societal impact.
- ðŸ’¬ Talking about open ideas in different fields, especially neuroscience and life sciences.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I (finally) have a self-hosted corner of the internet for articles and images (shoutout to [immich](https://immich.app/), [syncthing](https://syncthing.net/), [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/), [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) and [readeck](https://readeck.org/en/)).
